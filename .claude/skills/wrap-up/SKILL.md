# wrap-up — session memory persistence + hygiene sweep

Executes the session-end procedure defined in `CLAUDE.md` § Session Memory
「終了時ルール (自動トリガー)」 and § Archive policy. This skill is the
**executor**; `CLAUDE.md` is the **policy source of truth**. If this file and
`CLAUDE.md` ever diverge, `CLAUDE.md` wins — fix this skill rather than acting
on the stale copy.

Run it confirmation-free when a trigger phrase fires (that is the documented
contract), but still surface what you changed at the end.

## Why this is a skill, not prose

The procedure has a hard ordering and a hard gate that散文では構造的に保証
されない:

- **step 4 (`次の発行順序` sweep) must run before step 5 (`直近 merged`
  compaction)** — a single pass that moves completed entries into 直近 merged
  *then* re-evaluates the 5-cap.
- **step 8 (`python -m pytest tests/discipline/`) must run before any direct
  push** — the `.claude/memory/` main-push exception is post-hoc-only, so a
  discipline violation turns main red directly instead of being blocked by PR
  CI.

Walk the steps in order. Do not skip the gates.

## Procedure

### 1. Save the reflection
Write the session reflection to `.claude/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today = the
`currentDate` from context). If the file already exists for today, append a
new `## Session N` section instead of overwriting.

Use the conventional section layout (see `CLAUDE.md` § サマリーの構成):
**コンテキスト / 設計判断 / 成功パターン / 修正・訂正 / 工程サマリー (table) /
成果物 / 次セッションへの引き継ぎ / メモ**.

### 2. Append the index entry
Add **one 1–2 line bullet** to `.claude/memory/_index.md` under `## エントリ`,
in the existing format: `- YYYY-MM-DD: <主題 1〜2 文> (PR #NNN, ...)`. Newest
goes at the bottom. Keep the bullet ≤ 500 chars — this is enforced by
`tests/discipline/test_index_md_entry_compactness.py`. Do NOT essay-ify the
entry; the full narrative lives in the dated file.

### 3. Archive dated logs older than 30 days
Move any `YYYY-MM-DD.md` older than 30 days into
`.claude/memory/archive/YYYY-MM/`, preserving the original text verbatim
(zero information loss). Rewrite its `_index.md` bullet to a 1-line summary +
archive path. Update `.claude/memory/archive/INDEX.md`.

### 4. Sweep `STATUS.md` 次の発行順序  ⚠️ before step 5
In `.claude/memory/STATUS.md` § `## 次の発行順序`, remove any Phase / Brief /
Milestone item that has been **completed/merged**, converting it into a new
entry under `## 直近 merged`. Enforced by
`tests/discipline/test_status_md_next_queue_no_completed.py` (no completion
markers — ✅ / 完走 / merged / DONE — may remain in the queue section).

### 5. Compact `STATUS.md` 直近 merged
Keep only the most recent **5** entries inline under `## 直近 merged`. Move the
overflow (oldest first) to the end of
`.claude/memory/archive/STATUS_MERGED_LOG.md`, verbatim.

### 6. Check `STATUS.md ## Phase` is a single paragraph
`## Phase` must be exactly **one** paragraph. If you added a new paragraph,
delete the old one — do not leave both. Enforced by
`tests/discipline/test_status_md_phase_single_paragraph.py`.

### 7. Externalize 5+ round disputes
If any spec/ambiguity took **5+ rounds** of review or 壁打ち this session,
confirm its resolution is encoded in docs/tests. If not, externalize it now.
This is the core of Experience Externalization and is intentionally a checklist
item, not a test (a round-count test is a fragile proxy — see
`tests/discipline/README.md`). PR #104 (13 rounds) is the repo's base case for
why this matters: the planning doc absorbed the churn so the implementation PRs
should land in fewer rounds. If a `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` update is
warranted, propose it to the user.

### 8. Verify discipline tests, then push  ⚠️ gate
Run:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/discipline/ -q
```

Use `python -m pytest`, not bare `pytest`, to pin the invocation to the active
environment's pytest.

All tests in `tests/discipline/` MUST pass before pushing. A failure means
drift remains from steps 4–6 — fix the offending file and re-run; do NOT push
red. Only `.claude/memory/` changes may go direct to main (the memory
exception); everything else still needs a feature branch + PR.

## Closeout
After pushing, give the user a short summary: which memory files changed, any
archive moves, the discipline-test result, and any 5+ round item you
externalized or are proposing to encode.
